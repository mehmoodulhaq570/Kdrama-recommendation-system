Park Tae Yong, a public defender, was born as the son of an undertaker on an island. He did not take the typical route to become a lawyer. After graduating from high school, he did not go to a university. He later passed the bar exam and became a lawyer. He is full of justice and has  empathy for others. He will defend all kinds of petty offenders. A turning point occurs in his legal career when he becomes the first attorney to win a general criminal retrial case.

Park Sam Soo is a reporter. After he graduated from the university, he worked as a non-permanent employee. Thanks to his excellent writing skills, he became a reporter. He looks for stories which are ignored or passed over by other reporters. He is soft-hearted and easily moved to tears. Though his work does not bring him financial stability, his writings are able to deeply move the hearts of readers, some of whom volunteer their own resources and skills to support his journalism. 

Working with Sam Soo is Lee Yoo Kyung, who, despite a silver-spoon upbringing, is a brave, justice-seeking rookie whose first scoop is Tae Yong's victorious retrial case. Seeing Tae Yong's courtroom performance, Yoo Kyung is, like Sam Soo, struck by his passion, empathy, and drive to bring justice to the victim.

The firm is a busy, multinational company, but this is a team that most workers dream of getting out of – and where chaos is no stranger! Some 10 employees make up the team. These include Lee Sang Sik, a man with a positive personality who often misjudges his coworkers’ moods,  causing trouble as a result! There is also Cha Na Rae, the hot-tempered assistant manager! Also among their number is Baek Ma Tan, the heir of the owners of Gaus Electronics’ fiercest rival – Power Group. He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and has never known hardship. But he shocked his entire family when he decided to join Gaus as a junior employee! His polar opposite is Geon Gang Mi, who comes from more modest origins and has always tried to pull herself up by her bootstraps – pushing herself to succeed at every step (although she does have a tendency to change when she drinks alcohol!). 
While they seem to have very little in common at first, they slowly begin to form a bond, with possible sparks of romance in the air! Will any of the marketing team succeed in escaping? Or will they eventually find a way to quell the workplace chaos?

While an expert in how to achieve  physical pleasure, her understanding falls short of romantic relationships.

Pooling their lifetime of experiences and newfound knowledge, Mi Na and Hui Jae decide to make a major life change by opening a sex counseling service together. Working to help others find personal satisfaction, will these friends find the satisfaction they both crave?

But one day, he starts questioning his own judgment and tells a teacher that he no longer wishes to be alone. The problem is, he has no idea how to start going about making new friends. The teacher advises him to join the school’s student council. He agrees, but discovers that making friends may be harder than it  seems.

However, he also meets the super-attractive President of the council: Da On, who appears to take an instant shine to him. The beginnings of a romance appear to be in the cards for Da On and Tae Kyung, but Shin Woo does not seem to approve. Matters are further complicated by the fact that Da On’s close female friend – who secretly loves Da On – is jealous of their closeness, and attempts to drive a wedge between them!

Laws against imbibing, buying or making alcohol created different challenges for these inhabitants: Inspector Nam Young from The Office of the Inspector-General who left his hometown to achieve fame in Hanyang and restore his family status; Kang Ro Seo, the aristocratic but impoverished lady who makes moonshine to reduce her debt,  allowing her to continue buying her mother’s medication and her brother’s books; and even Crown Prince Lee Pyo, who was prone to scaling the palace walls in search of a tipple. 

This trio has a fateful encounter leading to the discovery of a hidden stash of alcohol. Revealing this secret would only result in certain death.

Phantom School,"Escuela de Fantasmas, Paenteomseukul","Nestled quietly in the heart of a buzzing community, there sits a school that to any who might pass it by, appears to be quite normal. However, as is often the case, looks can be quite deceiving. Inhabited by several malicious phantoms, this school plays host to more than its dedicated faculty and lively student body.

While most of the students at this school are largely unaware of the otherworldly beings who  exist beside them, some are easily swayed by the phantom’s presence. For those who are easily manipulated by the specters, life has a way of quickly becoming a living nightmare as they’re forced to give in to the evil desires of their ghastly tormentors. But even as some students are swayed by the phantoms, others have taken on the role of a hunter and have accepted the responsibility of fighting against them.

One such hunter, Lee Do Gyeom, has dedicated his life to this task. As a student currently enrolled in this phantom school, it’s up to him to save those afflicted by the evil which haunts its halls. But does he have the strength to take on this malicious force alone?

Despite the fact that he is an undeniable heartthrob, every time Nam Uk opens his mouth, he says the cheesiest things. How can he possibly win his leading lady's heart when everything he says seems to make her cringe?

Using any means necessary, Gang Ho goes above and beyond the call of duty to bring in the bad guys.

However, his passion and refusal to let misinformation slide earns him a reputation at work as a stubborn troublemaker who isn’t afraid to argue with his boss.

Cho Sam Dal  grew up with Cho Yong Pil. Unlike Cho Yong Pil, content to remain in his hometown of Samdalri, Cho Sam Dal makes it her mission to get out of their small town and move to Seoul. After years of toiling away as an assistant in the fashion photography industry, Cho Sam Dal—who changes her name to Cho Eun Hye in Seoul—finally succeeds and makes it to the top. However, when everything she’s worked so hard to build comes crashing down in the blink of an eye, she returns to Samdalri, where people still know her as Sam Dal and not Eun Hye.

Although Cho Yong Pil and Cho Sam Dal used to be joined at the hip when they were younger, the once inseparable friends are no longer in contact with one another due to an incident that drove them apart. When Cho Sam Dal returns to Samdalri, however, they find that the longtime affection they once had for one another comes rushing back.

Yoo I Seop is a quiet, reserved young man whose world shifts when he receives a call from an unknown number—one that wasn't meant for him. On the other end is Han U Tae, a bold and mysterious stranger whose voice becomes the beginning of something neither of them expected.

What starts as an accidental connection grows into something deeper as they continue to talk, night  after night. But both carry emotional scars, and neither of them has been entirely honest about who they are—or what they're hiding. When past traumas resurface and feelings grow complicated, they must confront their own fears before the line between comfort and pain disappears.

Can a mistake lead to something real? Or are they destined to be two strangers, forever just a voice on the other end?

Sometimes, the wrong number is the right person.

Though humans never give much thought to how they manage to function, day in and day out, the cells within the human body are constantly at work, doing their part to keep their humans alive and well. This is why, on the  outside, Kim Yu Mi may appear to be just like every other single working woman in the world, but underneath that ordinary exterior lies something truly extraordinary. 

Having recently suffered a painful breakup, Yu Mi’s love cells have fallen into a deep coma. While the surrounding cells work hard to revive their fallen compatriots, Yu Mi spends her days stuck in the grind of everyday life. With a heart still broken and no romantic prospects, Yu Mi’s love cells might have been in serious trouble had it not been for the sudden appearance of Koo Ung. An emotionally stunted game developer, Koo Ung, has no idea how to express his true feelings, but after meeting Yu Mi, he finds himself wanting to try. With his own love cells unexpectedly sparking Yu Mi’s back to life, things between the two start to get interesting.  With both Yu Mi and Koo Ung’s cells working overtime, the two find themselves drawing ever closer. 

But will the efforts of this small collection of cells really be enough to bring two hearts together forever?
